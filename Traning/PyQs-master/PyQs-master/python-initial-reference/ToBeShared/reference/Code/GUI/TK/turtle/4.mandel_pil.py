'''
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f( z ) = z**2 + c 
does not diverge when iterated from z = 0 , i.e.,
for which the sequence f( 0 ) , f ( f ( 0 ) ) etc., remains bounded in absolute value. 

for each sample point c , whether the sequence f( 0 ) , f ( f ( 0 ) ) ,...
goes to infinity (in practice -- whether it leaves some predetermined bounded neighborhood of 0 
after a predetermined number of iterations).

Treating the real and imaginary parts of c as image coordinates on the complex plane, 
pixels may then be coloured according to how soon the sequence | f ( 0 ) | , | f ( f ( 0 ) ) | ,...
crosses an arbitrarily chosen threshold, 
with a special color (usually black) used for the values of c 
for which the sequence has not crossed the threshold after the predetermined number of iterations 
(this is necessary to clearly distinguish the Mandelbrot set image from the image of its complement). 


If c is held constant and the initial value of z â€”denoted by z0 
is variable instead, one obtains the corresponding Julia set for each point c 
in the parameter space of the simple function.
